 Predicting Fruit Ripeness for Determining Expiry Time


 Project Focus
The project centers on developing a ripeness prediction system to determine the expiration time of fruits and vegetables. This system serves as part of the solution to reduce food wastage, enhance distribution efficiency, and support food self-reliance in striving towards greater food sovereignty.

 Dataset 

The dataset used for training and testing the model originates from the [FRINN repository](https://github.com/ece324-2020/FRINN). The goal of FRINN is to develop a model (NN) to classify both the state and type of an input fruit image. 

 FRINN Dataset Details:
 Fruit Types: Apples, Oranges, Bananas, Raspberries, Strawberries
  Fruit States: Ripe, Unripe, Rotten
